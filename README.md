## About the Project
DynAmi is an **interactive companion robot** designed to communicate naturally with users, recognize faces and emotions, navigate autonomously, and provide an immersive experience through an AI-powered mobile application.

This project integrates **robotics, embedded systems, computer vision, speech recognition, and generative AI**, creating a unique platform for human-robot interaction.

---

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation** – Obstacle detection & avoidance using IR sensors  
- **Bidirectional Communication** – App ↔ Server ↔ Raspberry Pi ↔ STM32 ↔ Robot  
- **Voice Recognition & Speech Synthesis** – Using Python (SpeechRecognition & gTTS)  
- **Facial Recognition & Emotion Detection** – OpenCV, face_recognition & DeepFace  
- **Individual Detection & Tracking** – YOLOv4-based object detection  
- **Interactive Mobile App** – Control the robot, chat with AI, receive alerts  
- **Audio Output (Speaker)** – Amplified audio responses using LM4871
